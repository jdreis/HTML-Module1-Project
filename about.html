        <h2>Origin Story</h2>
            <img src="./assets/images/about.jpg" alt="">
            <p>H-Thai-ML was originally opened in Raleigh, North Carolina when a 
                young entrepreneur based out of the area wanted to share her love for Thai cuisine. 
                It became an instant success, only after asking her mother for a small loan of one million 
                amounts of money to actually be able to manufacture the restaurant and hire all the staff. Nevertheless, as business was booming, she continued 
                her passion and opened another location in Durham, North Carolina, only a city away from where the original location had opened. 
                She dearly loved her loyal customers and regulars, yet wanted to try something different. 
                In an effort of trying to decipher if her food was authentic enough, she decided to 
                move to where Thai originated from, Thailand! She opened her third location in 
                Wang Thong, Thailand, and only after a year became one of the best-known 
                Thai restaurants known to Thailand. She figured she was born for this, due to the 
                obvious and somewhat random success. From North Carolina, across the 
                globe to Thailand itself, and finally settling down in New York City, Jena Reis welcomes you to H-Thai-ML!
